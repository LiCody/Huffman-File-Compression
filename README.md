# Huffman-File-Compression
Takes a .txt file and turns it into a binary tree with characters of the file as the leaves. Then creates a path by going through the tree.  Next creates a hashtable with the paths and turns the .txt file into binary. Finally turns the binary into ascii and writes the new ascii to a .txt file
